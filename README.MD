# Tetris-Cpp

Based on this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVYKG_ch4yM) with 'some' modifications.

Since I used this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anEqFr8sJnA&t=273s) to install raylib with education purpose. The game has no audio since the project's missing the required files.
